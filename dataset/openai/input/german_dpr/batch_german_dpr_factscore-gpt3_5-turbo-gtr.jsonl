he has no authority to deviate from them in any detail.\"Teams of people, often women from the late nineteenth century onwards, were used to undertake long and often tedious calculations; the work was divided so that this could be done in parallel.The same calculations were frequently performed independently by separate teams to check the correctness of the results.Since the end of the 20th century, the term \"human computer\" has also been applied to individuals with prodigious powers of mental arithmetic, also known as mental calculators.\n\nTitle: computer \nText:  store and retrieve large amounts of data very quickly;

the 5 and 42nd Street Shuttle (S) trains at all times except late nights; the <6> train during weekdays in the peak direction; and the  <7> train during rush hours and early evenings in the peak direction.The station is adjacent to Grand Central Terminal, which serves all Metro-North Railroad lines east of the Hudson River.There are multiple exits to Grand Central Terminal and to nearby buildings such as One Vanderbilt and the Chrysler Building.Numerous elevators make the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.The present shuttle station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as an express station on the city's first subway line, which was approved in 1900.The station opened on October 27, 1904\n\nTitle: Grand Central Terminal \nText: 's Main ConcGrand Central Terminal contains a variety of stores and food vendors, including upscale restaurants and bars, a food hall, and a grocery marketplace.The building is also noted for its library, event hall, tennis club, control center and offices for the railroad, and sub-basement power station.Grand Central Terminal was built by and named for the New York Central Railroad; it also served the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and, later, successors to the New York Central.Opened in 1913, the terminal was built on the site of two similarly named predecessor stations, the first of which dated to 1871.Grand Central Terminal served intercity trains until 1991, when Amtrak began routing its trains through nearby Penn Station.Grand Central covers 48 acres (19 ha) and has 44 platforms, more than any other railroad station in the world.Its platforms, all below ground, serve 30 tracks on the upper level and 26 on the lower.In total, there are 67 tracks, including a rail yard and sidings;

Stewart Memorial Highway by the state legislature in 2016, after a campaign to replace an unofficial moniker honoring Confederate president Jefferson Davis.SR 99 was originally a section of U.S. Route 99 (US 99), which was once the state's primary north\u2013south highway before the construction of I-5.US 99 was created in 1926 and replaced earlier local roads that date back to the 1890s and state roads designated as early as 1913.The highway was moved onto the Alaskan Way Viaduct in 1953, replacing a congested stretch through Downtown Seattle, and other sections were built to expressway standards in the 1950s.US 99 was ultimately replaced by the\n\nTitle: Broadway (1929 film) \nText: Broadway is a 1929 film directed by Paul Fejos from the 1926 play of the same name by George Abbott and Philip Dunning.It stars Glenn Tryon, Evelyn Brent, Paul Porcasi, Robert Ellis, Merna Kennedy and Thomas E.
